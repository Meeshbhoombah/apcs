# Algorithmic Analysis Outline
## Intro
- Two routes metaphor:
    + Estimate duration to traverse
    + Primary focus:
        * Number of potential red lights
        * Length of path
    + Potential other factors that are too variable to focus on
        * Car accidents
        * Cars  
        * Road damage
    + Choose to focus on the two known constants, or quantifiable/tangible components of both 
      your paths
    + Too many things to consider - number of cars, accidents, road damage etc.
    + Luckily one factor can have a marginally greater impact than the rest: route length
        * Can also provide the most accurate estimation as we can make a genuine comparison
          between the length of the two routes that would give a good way to make a hypothesis
          about which of the two routes are longer
    + You may have your bike - one route may be faster than the other when on a bike
    + Time of day could change the context of this completly

# 
- Algorithmic analysis = this applied to computer science
- Unnecessary (though usable) factors for algorithmic analysis:
    + Hardware - use a **machine model** == detrements on the road (too variable)
    + Inputs - **worst/best case analysis** == have your bike (context)
    + Dataset variations - compare **asymptotically** == consider time of day
