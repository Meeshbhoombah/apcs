# Algorithmic Analysis
Consider the multiple paths you can take to get home from school. Perhaps you and a friend are
walking home together on the path you take on a daily basis. There is a moment of awkward 
confusion when she takes a step left at a bend where you planned to go right. She looks at 
you suprised. You look at her confused. To cease the awkward tension she beings to describes 
the route she usually takes to get to your house from school.

She's sure that the route she takes is much more efficient. On what basis can you assert or
deny that claim?

First, let's consider how she came to the conclusion. It's likely that she first took into 
account a number of factors that could feasibly effect the walk from Point A to Point B:
- Distance
- Potential red lights
- Cars
- Accidents
- Roadwork
- Time of Day

Since neither of you specified a constraint on the timeframe, it is likely that she
did not factor in the time of day. Furthermore, it would be impossible for her to 
communicate, let alone know, every combination of how long a path may take at a given 
time of day.

Unless one of you preemtively knows otherwise, number of cars, accidents, or any 
possibility of roadwork is a completely variable case. Furthermore, If you two are talking
in generalized statements about the alternative routes, these factors are not relevant. As
time progresses these factors will almost indefinetly change. It is important to note,
however, that when they do arise they could potentially change the outcome of the comparison; 
that is, the path that is generally the quickest may have a blockcade that 
would prevent it from being so. Had either of you specified a certain time frame then
it would be important to take these factors into consideration.

As such, what remains are constant, tangible measures of the relevant comparable attributes
of the two routes.
- Distance
- Potential red lights (or, the number of stop lights)

Why was it okay for her to just ignore these factors? Does that not make her answer less
precise? It was probably because she assumed that you were asking for an estimation. To 
want a precise answer for such a general question would not be possible. It would be
difficult to say with absolute certainty that a particular route would be faster than another
particular route because there may be variables that have not been accounted for, and,
given specefic cases, it can be said with absolute certainty that the opposite is true.

## Deep Dive


## Pratical
A good grasp of algorithmic analysis is arguably one of the most useful skills a software
engineer can have. The ultimate goal of algorithmic analysis is to drive design decisions about
how a specefic program should be built to address the needs of the context in which it is defined.

The easiest way to gague the runtime of a Python program is to use the tactic of benchmarking, 
which entails literally measuring the difference in our software's start and stop time.
