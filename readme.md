# AP Computer Science
Computer science taught the right way through a reasonable progression with thoughoutful
explinations.

I've heard so many instances of students complaining that their computer science teachers did
not provide them with the best course of study for learning computer science. It's invaluable to
me that they are given this opportunity because for a number of reasons:
1. Programming is the new computer literacy
2. Computer literacy can provide a basis for escaping systemic boundaries
3. Co-operative improvement of computer science is working to improve humanity
