# Computer Science
Teaching myself computer science üî¨ with implementations in Python üêç by teaching you the same.

## Usage
My recommended guide for using this repository can be found here. Don't worry, I've made it
relatively easy to start learning with `cs`.

## Background
I'm a software engineer and maker at heart, the combination of which have made me an avid
autodidact, always on the ambitious journey for more knowledge. I find myself pursuing a 
self study on many topics, computer science was one of them.

I was also at the age of 14 when I first started exploring computer science. Self-studying the
more complex conficts was very difficult because I could not fundamentally grasp the
concepts, and while the vocab and their definitions stuck, the usage of terminology did
not.

Years later, when I decided to revisit the root of my `cs` knowledge at Make School, I
realize I felt as though I was lacking in my foundations. I saw an opportunity to strength
these by re-learning the foundations while also creating a way to actuate more self-starters
into the world I find myself in now. The ability to build many of the things I want to is a 
great power, I really want to help others revile in that same ability.
